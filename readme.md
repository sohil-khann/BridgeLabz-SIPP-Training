This repository contains various Java programming examples and projects, categorized by topic.

## Java Inheritance Examples

This section demonstrates different aspects of inheritance in Java:

*   `SingleInheritance.java`: Illustrates single inheritance with a `Dog` class extending an `Animal` class.
*   `MultiLevelInheritance.java`: Shows multi-level inheritance with a `BabyDog` class extending `Dog`, which in turn extends `Animal`.
*   `HierarchicalInheritance.java`: Demonstrates hierarchical inheritance where `Dog` and `Cat` classes both extend the `Animal` class.

Each example includes a `main` method to demonstrate the inheritance concept.

## Java Linked List Examples

This section provides implementations of various linked list types and their applications:

### Singly Linked List

*   `StudentManagementSystem.java`: Implements a Student Management System using a singly linked list.
*   `PlaylistManager.java`: Implements a Playlist Manager using a singly linked list.
*   `SocialMediaFriendConnections.java`: Implements a Social Media Friend Connections system.

### Doubly Linked List

*   `MovieManagementSystem.java`: Implements a Movie Management System.
*   `LibraryManagementSystem.java`: Implements a Library Management System.
*   `TextEditorUndoRedo.java`: Implements Undo/Redo functionality for a text editor.

### Circular Linked List

*   `TaskScheduler.java`: Implements a Task Scheduler.
*   `RoundRobinScheduling.java`: Implements a Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm.
*   `OnlineTicketReservationSystem.java`: Implements an Online Ticket Reservation System.

Each linked list implementation includes a `main` method for user interaction and demonstration of its functionalities.       

## Java Sorting Examples

This section contains implementations of various sorting algorithms:

*   `BubbleSortStudentMarks.java`: Sorts student marks using Bubble Sort.
*   `InsertionSortEmployeeIDs.java`: Sorts employee IDs using Insertion Sort.
*   `MergeSortBookPrices.java`: Sorts book prices using Merge Sort.
*   `QuickSortProductPrices.java`: Sorts product prices using Quick Sort.
*   `SelectionSortExamScores.java`: Sorts exam scores using Selection Sort.
*   `HeapSortJobApplicants.java`: Sorts job applicant salaries using Heap Sort.
*   `CountingSortStudentAges.java`: Sorts student ages using Counting Sort.

Each file contains a `main` method for independent execution and demonstration of the sorting algorithm.

## Java Algorithm Analysis Examples

This section provides examples comparing the performance of different algorithms and data structures:

*   `SearchPerformance.java`: Compares the performance of Linear Search and Binary Search.
*   `SortingAlgorithmComparison.java`: Compares Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.
*   `StringConcatenationPerformance.java`: Compares `String`, `StringBuilder`, and `StringBuffer` for concatenation.
*   `FileReadingEfficiency.java`: Compares `FileReader` and `InputStreamReader` for large file reading.
*   `FibonacciComputation.java`: Compares Recursive vs. Iterative Fibonacci computation.
*   `DataStructureSearchPerformance.java`: Compares Array, HashSet, and TreeSet for searching elements.

Each file includes a `main` method to demonstrate the performance comparison.
