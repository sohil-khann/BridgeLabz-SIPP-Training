# BridgeLabz SIPP Training Projects

This repository contains various Java programming examples and problem solutions developed during the BridgeLabz SIPP Training.

## Java Inheritance Examples

This section includes examples demonstrating different types of inheritance in Java:

*   `SchoolSystemRoles.java`: Demonstrates single inheritance with `Person`, `Teacher`, `Student`, and `Staff` classes.
*   `RestaurantManagement.java`: Demonstrates multilevel inheritance with `Person`, `Employee`, `Chef`, and `Waiter` classes.
*   `VehicleManagement.java`: Demonstrates hierarchical inheritance with `Vehicle`, `ElectricVehicle`, and `PetrolVehicle` classes.
*   `AnimalHierarchy.java`: Demonstrates polymorphism and inheritance with `Animal`, `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Bird` classes.
*   `EmployeeManagementSystem.java`: Demonstrates inheritance with `Employee`, `Manager`, `Developer`, and `Intern` classes.
*   `VehicleTransportSystem.java`: Demonstrates inheritance with `Vehicle`, `Car`, `Truck`, and `Motorcycle` classes.

Each file contains a `main` method for independent execution and demonstration of the concepts.

## Linked List Examples

This section contains various linked list implementations for different problem statements:

### Singly Linked List

*   `StudentRecordManagement.java`: Implements a Student Record Management system.
*   `InventoryManagementSystem.java`: Implements an Inventory Management System.
*   `SocialMediaFriendConnections.java`: Implements a Social Media Friend Connections system.

### Doubly Linked List

*   `MovieManagementSystem.java`: Implements a Movie Management System.
*   `LibraryManagementSystem.java`: Implements a Library Management System.
*   `TextEditorUndoRedo.java`: Implements Undo/Redo functionality for a text editor.

### Circular Linked List

*   `TaskScheduler.java`: Implements a Task Scheduler.
*   `RoundRobinScheduling.java`: Implements a Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm.
*   `OnlineTicketReservationSystem.java`: Implements an Online Ticket Reservation System.

Each linked list implementation includes a `main` method for user interaction and demonstration of its functionalities.
