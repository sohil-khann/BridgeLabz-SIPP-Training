## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository is organized by branches, each representing a week of focused learning.
| Branch Name                  | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CoreJava`           | Covers basic Java syntax, control structures, arrays, strings, and I/O.     |
| `OOPS`                | Focuses on object-oriented programming concepts like classes, inheritance.  |
| `DSA`                 | Implementation of basic data structures (Stack, Queue, LinkedList, etc).    |
| `Workshop`            | Workshop projects combining Java concepts in real-world scenarios.          |
| `GenericsCollections` | Implementation and problems of Generics and Collections Framework in Java.               |
| `main`                      | Final clean code merged from all branches.                                  |
